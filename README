gogive is a tool that establishes an arbitrary mapping between
a list of import paths and their source control repositories for use
with the `go get` tool. This allows you to, for example, construct
meaningful import paths under your own site name, such as

	import "example.org/net/lldp"

While still taking advantage of third-party code hosting sites like github,
which offer a lot in terms of scalability and collabaration tools (issues, etc).

To run `gogive`, create a configuration file with lines of the form

	prefix vcs repo

Where `prefix` is the import path prefix, `vcs` is the version control tool,
and `repo` is the url of the actual source repository. Then run `gogive`:

	$ gogive /path/to/gogive-config-file

For use as a service, run it under a supervisor such as Upstart, daemontools,
supervisord, or systemd.
